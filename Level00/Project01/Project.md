Project Statement: Basic PC-to-PC Connectivity

Overview:
    This project aims to design, configure, and verify a direct, peer-to-peer network connection between two PCs using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective is to establish basic connectivity without the use of intermediary devices such as switches or routers, thereby focusing on fundamental networking concepts like static IP addressing and basic troubleshooting.

Objectives:

    Create a point-to-point connection between two PCs using an appropriate cable (e.g., a crossover cable).
    Configure each PC with a static IP address and corresponding subnet mask to enable direct communication.
    Validate the connection through practical tests such as the ping utility, ensuring reliable data transmission between the two endpoints.
    Document the entire process, from physical connection and IP configuration to connectivity verification and troubleshooting.

Scope:
    Network Design: Set up a simple, direct link between two PCs without incorporating any switches or routers.
    Device Configuration: Manually assign static IP addresses and subnet masks on both PCs, ensuring they belong to the same network segment.
    Testing & Verification: Use Cisco Packet Tracerâ€™s simulation tools to run connectivity tests (e.g., ping tests) to confirm that both PCs can communicate effectively.
    Documentation: Produce a network diagram and a comprehensive configuration report detailing each step taken, test outcomes, and lessons learned.

Deliverables:

    A network diagram illustrating the direct connection between the two PCs.
    A configuration document listing the IP settings, subnet masks, and any other relevant parameters.
    A connectivity test report summarizing the results of the ping tests and any troubleshooting steps performed.
    A brief reflection document outlining key insights and recommendations for future connectivity projects.

Timeline:
    This project is designed to be completed within one week, providing ample time for setup, configuration, testing, and documentation.


Expected Outcomes:
    Successful establishment of a direct PC-to-PC connection without relying on intermediary networking devices.
    Practical understanding of static IP configuration and basic troubleshooting methods.
    A solid foundational experience that will prepare participants for more complex network setups in future projects.


Professional Relevance:
    In real-world scenarios, direct PC-to-PC connectivity is often required for tasks such as ad-hoc data transfers, establishing temporary networks, or small office/home office (SOHO) environments. This project reinforces essential networking skills in a controlled environment, ensuring that practitioners develop a strong grasp of the basics before advancing to more complex configurations.



Out Comes:
    Difference between STRAIT-FORWARD and CrossOver.
