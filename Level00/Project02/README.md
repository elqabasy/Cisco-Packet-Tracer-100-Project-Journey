Project Statement: Single Switch LAN Setup

Overview:
    This project is designed to build a basic Local Area Network (LAN) by connecting four PCs to a single switch using Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience in manually configuring static IP addressing and ensuring reliable inter-PC communication within a controlled network environment.

Objectives:
    Network Design: Establish a simple LAN topology where all four PCs are directly connected to one central switch.
    IP Configuration: Manually assign unique static IP addresses and appropriate subnet masks to each PC, ensuring they belong to the same network segment.
    Connectivity Verification: Conduct thorough testing using tools such as the ping command to confirm that each PC can successfully communicate with every other PC on the network.
    Troubleshooting: Identify and resolve any connectivity issues that may arise during the setup process.

Scope:
    Physical and Logical Setup: Create the network using a single switch to interconnect the four PCs, ensuring that the physical layout and logical addressing scheme are well-documented.
    Device Configuration: Manually configure network settings on each PC, including IP addresses, subnet masks, and any other necessary parameters.
    Testing and Validation: Perform connectivity tests across all PCs to verify the integrity and reliability of the network.
    Documentation: Generate a comprehensive report that includes the network diagram, configuration details, testing outcomes, and any troubleshooting steps taken.

Deliverables:
    A detailed network diagram illustrating the LAN topology with all four PCs connected to the single switch.
    A configuration report documenting the static IP addresses, subnet masks, and settings used on each device.
    A test report summarizing the results of connectivity tests (e.g., ping tests) and any remedial actions implemented.
    A brief reflection section highlighting key lessons learned and recommendations for similar future projects.

Timeline:
    This project is expected to be completed within one day, including network setup, configuration, testing, and documentation.

Expected Outcomes:
Successful establishment of a LAN where all PCs communicate seamlessly with one another.
Practical understanding of static IP addressing and the importance of proper network configuration.
Development of troubleshooting skills through the identification and resolution of connectivity issues.

Professional Relevance:
    The Single Switch LAN Setup project mirrors real-world scenarios commonly encountered in small office or educational environments. Mastering this fundamental task is essential for network professionals, as it lays the groundwork for more complex network configurations and troubleshooting methodologies in larger-scale environments.
