# Networking Mastery with Cisco Packet Tracer: From Basics to Enterprise-Level Projects

## Overview
This repository documents my journey toward mastering networking through practical projects using Cisco Packet Tracer. Over the course of this journey, I have completed 100 carefully curated projects that range from foundational connectivity exercises (Level 0) to advanced, enterprise-scale network challenges (Hero-level). Each project was designed to build on the previous one, ensuring a solid understanding of topics such as basic switching and routing, inter-VLAN routing, dynamic routing protocols, NAT, VPNs, and much more.

The project statements were generated by ChatGPT and have provided a structured pathway to learn, implement, and troubleshoot a variety of networking scenarios. This repository serves as both a personal record of my progress and a resource for anyone looking to enhance their practical networking skills.

## Project Structure
- **Level 0:** Basic Connectivity Projects (Projects 1–20)
- **Level 1:** Introductory Networking Projects (Projects 21–40)
- **Level 2:** Intermediate Networking Projects (Projects 41–60)
- **Level 3:** Advanced Networking Projects (Projects 61–80)
- **Level 4:** Hero-Level Networking Projects (Projects 81–100)

## Timeline
To maintain focus and ensure steady progress, I have established an estimated timeline for completing each set of projects. This roadmap is designed to help monitor progress, maintain accountability, and serve as a reference for future updates.

- **Phase 1 – Foundations (Level 0: Projects 1–20):**  
  *Duration: Weeks 1–4*  
  Focus on basic connectivity, switch and router configurations, and introductory troubleshooting exercises.

- **Phase 2 – Introductory Projects (Level 1: Projects 21–40):**  
  *Duration: Weeks 5–8*  
  Explore inter-VLAN routing, DHCP server configurations, basic NAT, ACLs, and introductory wireless setups.

- **Phase 3 – Intermediate Projects (Level 2: Projects 41–60):**  
  *Duration: Weeks 9–12*  
  Delve into dynamic routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP), IPv6 addressing, advanced DHCP, NAT/PAT, and network segmentation techniques.

- **Phase 4 – Advanced Projects (Level 3: Projects 61–80):**  
  *Duration: Weeks 13–16*  
  Tackle complex topics such as multi-area OSPF, advanced EIGRP features, sophisticated NAT scenarios, network automation, and advanced troubleshooting.

- **Phase 5 – Hero-Level Projects (Level 4: Projects 81–100):**  
  *Duration: Weeks 17–20*  
  Work on enterprise-scale challenges, including OSPF and BGP integration, MPLS, data center network design, SDN implementations, and a comprehensive capstone project.

- **Capstone and Review:**  
  *Duration: Week 21 (and beyond)*  
  Complete the final capstone project that integrates all advanced concepts and document lessons learned. Use this phase for self-review and planning future learning enhancements.

*Note: This timeline is an estimated guide and may be adjusted based on real-world progress or unforeseen challenges. The objective is to maintain a structured approach that keeps the learning journey on track while allowing for flexibility.*
